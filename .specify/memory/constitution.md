# Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Scientific Accuracy
All technical claims about AI, robotics, sensors, actuators, and algorithms must be supported by primary research sources.

### Clarity for Academic & Technical Audience
Writing should be understandable for readers with a background in AI, robotics, or computer science.

### Reproducibility & Traceability
All procedures, case studies, and experiments must be cited with sources or references to original research.

### Rigor
Prefer peer-reviewed journals, IEEE papers, and recognized AI/robotics publications.

## Key Standards

- Every factual claim must be traceable to a verifiable source.
- Citation format: APA style.
- Source composition: minimum 50% from peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings.
- Plagiarism: 0% tolerance; all text must be original or properly quoted.
- Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 for technical readability.

## Constraints

- Word count: 20,000–30,000 words (full-length technical book).
- Minimum 50 sources.
- Format: Markdown for Docusaurus compatibility, with embedded citations.
- Include diagrams, code snippets, or illustrative examples where relevant.

## Success Criteria

- All technical claims verified against cited sources.
- Zero plagiarism detected.
- Fact-checking review passed by technical advisor or AI/robotics expert.
- Content structured in clear chapters with introduction, main content, and conclusion.
- Ready for deployment to Docusaurus and GitHub Pages.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with this constitution.
