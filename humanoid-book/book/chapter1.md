# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the first chapter of our book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. In this chapter, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence, and set the stage for the rest of the book.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating intelligent agents that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI, which is often confined to the digital realm, Physical AI is all about bringing AI into the real world.

## The Embodied Cognition Thesis

The embodied cognition thesis is the idea that intelligence is not just a property of the brain, but rather emerges from the interaction between an agent's body, its environment, and its brain. In this section, we will explore this idea in more detail and discuss its implications for the design of intelligent robots.

## A Brief History of AI and Robotics

To understand the current state of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, it is important to have a basic understanding of the history of these fields. In this section, we will provide a brief overview of the key milestones in the history of AI and robotics, from the early days of cybernetics to the present day.
