# Chapter 2: A Brief History of Humanoid Robotics (1950–2025)

In this chapter, we will take a journey through the history of humanoid robotics, from its earliest beginnings to the state-of-the-art robots of today.

## The Early Years: WABOT and the First Humanoids

The dream of creating a machine in the likeness of a human is an old one, but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that the first true humanoid robots began to emerge. In this section, we will look at some of the pioneering work in this field, including the WABOT project at Waseda University in Japan.

## The Rise of Dynamic Locomotion: ASIMO and the Honda P-Series

One of the biggest challenges in humanoid robotics is creating a robot that can walk and move like a human. In this section, we will look at the development of dynamic locomotion, from the early work on ZMP control to the groundbreaking achievements of Honda's ASIMO and the P-series robots.

## The Modern Era: Atlas, Digit, and the Rise of Commercial Humanoids

In recent years, we have seen a rapid acceleration in the development of humanoid robots. In this section, we will look at some of the most advanced humanoid robots of today, including Boston Dynamics' Atlas and Agility Robotics' Digit, and discuss the rise of commercial humanoids.
