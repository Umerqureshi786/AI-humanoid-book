# Chapter 3: Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control of Bipedal Humanoids

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles that govern the movement of humanoid robots. We will explore the mathematical tools used to describe the motion of a robot's limbs, the forces that act on it, and the control strategies used to make it move in a desired way.

## Forward and Inverse Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. In this section, we will look at the two main problems in kinematics: forward kinematics, which is the problem of finding the position of the end of a robot's limb given the angles of its joints, and inverse kinematics, which is the problem of finding the joint angles required to place the end of a robot's limb in a desired position.

## Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters

The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention is a widely used method for describing the geometry of a robot's limbs. In this section, we will explain how to use DH parameters to create a mathematical model of a robot's kinematics.

## Lagrangian and Newtonian Dynamics

Dynamics is the study of motion and the forces that cause it. In this section, we will introduce two methods for deriving the equations of motion for a robot: the Lagrangian method, which is based on the concept of energy, and the Newtonian method, which is based on the concept of forces and torques.

## Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and Whole-Body Control

The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is a key concept in the control of bipedal locomotion. In this section, we will explain what the ZMP is and how it is used to generate stable walking gaits. We will also discuss the concept of whole-body control, which is a method for coordinating the motion of all of a robot's joints to achieve a desired task.
